general lab outline:

go over matlab and cover things that we cover in class with a more hands on approach and
doing this work in person.

having a problem to try and work on, 
then we can go through and try and work through problems together with given solutions.

the lab time will also be an oppritunity to go over homework that was due thursday's answers and how
to solve them.
